# Shopping Application

This is a shopping application developed in two weeks as part of MaGIC Full Stack Web Development bootcamp with the following project requirements:

* Users can view the landing page to find out more about the site.
* Users can view, add, and remove items available in the store without requiring to log in.
* Users checking out would need to log in first.
* Users can log in via email/password or through Facebook.
* Users can make payments through braintree, a credit card payment provider, or billplz.
* Users can search for items using keywords.
* Admin users can update orders as delivered, or add new items to the store using an admin panel.
